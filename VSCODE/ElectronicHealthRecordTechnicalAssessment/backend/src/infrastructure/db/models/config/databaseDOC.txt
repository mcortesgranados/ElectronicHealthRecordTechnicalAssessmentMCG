üìå How This Class Plays Its Role in Hexagonal Architecture
In hexagonal architecture, this database.ts file is part of the Infrastructure Layer, responsible for establishing and managing the database connection.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Responsibility as an Infrastructure Component

- Database Connection: It configures Sequelize to connect to a MySQL database.
- Encapsulation of Persistence Logic: It abstracts direct SQL interactions, providing an ORM-based solution.
- Security & Environment Handling: Uses environment variables to manage database credentials securely.
- Synchronization with Models: Ensures that database schema is in sync with the application‚Äôs domain models.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How It Interacts with Other Layers

This file acts as the interface between the database and the rest of the application:

- Domain Layer (Business Logic)
- The domain layer should not directly interact with the database.
- Application Layer (Services)
- Services handle business logic and call repositories to fetch or persist data.
- Repository Layer (Data Access Layer)
- The repository layer interacts with Sequelize (provided by database.ts) to execute queries.
- Infrastructure Layer (Database - database.ts)
- The repository layer depends on this Sequelize instance to perform CRUD operations.
- Database (MySQL)
- database.ts establishes the connection and ensures smooth interaction with the database.

‚úÖ Key Benefits of This Approach

‚úÖ Encapsulation - The database logic is isolated from business logic.
‚úÖ Scalability - Easily switch to a different database by changing the configuration.
‚úÖ Security - Credentials are stored in environment variables rather than hardcoded in the codebase.
‚úÖ Maintainability - Centralized database configuration simplifies debugging and updates.
‚úÖ Testability - Can use a different database (e.g., an in-memory DB like SQLite) during testing.
